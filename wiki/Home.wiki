SEAT is a tool designed to create seating charts for classrooms.  The software is designed to be easy to use and can print out professional looking seating charts.  You can add students to the tool one at a time or import your class roster from a CSV file.  You can save your student list and rooms so you can come back later to make modifications or view the seating charts.

Create custom room templates so you can quickly place students.  The classroom must be a square, but individual spaces can be marked as not-seats to represent spaces in the room.  Additionally, you can mark individual seats that should remain empty.  Each seat can be manually or automatically numbered so that students know where to sit in the classroom.  Once you have created a room layout for your classroom, a template will save you time in the future.

Place students automatically using one of a number of seating algorithms or manually places students one at a time.  Student preferences for handedness (left handed desk) and vision impairment (front of classroom) are attempted to be met.  Reserving seats allows for students to be spaced out in large classrooms.

You can automatically reserve seats using the following patterns:
  * Checkerboard
  * Every Other Row
  * Every Other Column
  * Left Side of Room
  * Right Side of Room
  * Back of Room

You can place students using the following algorithms:
  * Best Effort
  * Visually Impaired Only
  * Left Handed Only
